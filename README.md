## My First React Native App

- In this project, I just wanted to improve my style skills on React Native and used Flex layout.

- With Flexbox, you can split the screen into equal parts horizontally or vertically as you wish.

- If you want to improve your skills , check the documentation on this website [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox#flex).
